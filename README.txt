abosolute disaster that somehow works

- dont like how im searching areas
- powerup use should be in the class but its way easier to put it outside of the class
- adding another move when theres a wrong input to loop back to the beginning: idk if thats really good or really bad
- should have KOs only be tracked when objective is to KO enemies but ¯\_▐ ☯ ︿ ☯ ▐_/¯
