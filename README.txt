abosolute disaster that somehow works

- will put in shooting weapons later
- should bowser be able to move?

- I recommend buffing the items because in my testing the game is pretty unplayable unless you have the hammer, then its kinda playable
(items are location in the Mario and Map class)
- had program check for KO end game after every attack and find peach end after every search instead of all at the end
kinda weird that you can reach your goal, then die after and lose.
- you can walk into a location with like 5~ enemies, and if your weapon is bad + you dont have an escape/clear item, you're just dead
- you can spawn at an exit or where peach is and win instantly if there are no enemies around
- bowsers are also pretty unbalanced since the chance of having a bobomb on you is pretty unlikely.
5 powerups, 40% chance a location has a powerup in the first place



- have to check if my avilableLocation array is empty in both my connect and connect all class, tried to label the
loops but its local to both functions so no work.
- dont like how im searching areas
- powerup use should be in the class but its way easier to put it outside of the class
- adding another move when theres a wrong input to loop back to the beginning: idk if thats really good or really bad
- should have KOs only be tracked when objective is to KO enemies but ¯\_▐ ☯ ︿ ☯ ▐_/¯
- for some reason when attacking, using currentLocation.hitNumGoomba(currentLocation.getnNumGoomba); which
just hits the enemy the amount of enemies times, which should just set it to 0 but it doesn't. I have to use
a function to hard set the amount of enemies to 0. | i swapped my getters >:^(
- for checking if the player has won or not, idk if using boolean functions or just hard coding it in is better



 - (´_ゝ`) pretty much sums up how i feel about this entire program
